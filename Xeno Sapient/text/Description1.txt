“… But hey, another 40 years another dollar am I right?”
“Hahahaha another few million dollars!”

You overhear the other workers chit chat. Everyone is nervous yet excited.

“First time in Cryo? Going in is not the hard part, it’s coming back out with 20 years of wear and tear to your frozen ass that will get ya’ reeling.”

You feel unnaturally calm about the whole ordeal. 20 years out 20 years back with about 6 months of hard work in-between. Everyone was loading into the Theseus, a deep-space faring ship tasked with this 40 year voyage to build a long range listening outpost for the African-European Trade Partnership (AETP). Countdown had started and everyone was loading into the ship. In another 12 hours all 48 members of the crew will be in deep cryogenic sleep traveling at half-relative speeds towards the Ultima Thule, a promising star system in the Sea of Mesmer roughly 10 light-years away. 

Someone pats you on the shoulder, the captain, one of two people who is actually above you in the chain of command onboard. “You excited? This isn’t your first time trading half a millennia I understand.”

=================
“...”
“I never really fit in with society.”
“I enjoy helping humanity push the bounds of what is possible.”
=================

“Hurmph,” the captain sighs, “It’s time we ship out.”

Loading was uneventful. As a “critical new member” you passively helped oversee non-critical crew put to sleep in cryo before launch. You strapped yourself in and felt the exertion of 3x standard Earth gravity attempt to liquify your insides. After preforming several critical checks the captain gave the order, and the crew who supervised launch were put under. Your last thought as you slipped into a 20 year, dreamless sleep…

===========
“Finally to be off that God-forsaken asteroid away from these God-forsaken people.”  
“Finally to be off to a stretch of the universe never before seen by anything.”
“I wonder what’s for breakfast.”
