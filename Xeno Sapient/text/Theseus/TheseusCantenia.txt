A large room dedicated to eating. There are 4 large tables each with 6 chairs arranged in a square in the center of the room. Along the back wall are a few re-hydration units for hungry workers to quickly prepare a prepackaged MRE. This room, like all other rooms on the Theseus, is way to small to accommodate everyone. People eat in shifts.
