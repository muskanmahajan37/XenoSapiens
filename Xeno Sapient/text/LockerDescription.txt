Each locker looks the same on the outside, roughly 6 feet tall, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Each locker is airtight, in case of catastrophic failure the contents will, in theory, be ok. So long as whatever is inside can handle the near 0 degrees of deep space. 
On the center of each door is an inlaid palm reader with itâ€™s own battery source, again in case of spacing to keep scavengers out. Although, this security is mostly for show, the lock itself is very cheep and a crowbar, large stone or even just a well placed shoulder charge could break the lock.
