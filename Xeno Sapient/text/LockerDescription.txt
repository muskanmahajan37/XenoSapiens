Each locker looks the same on the outside, roughly 6 feet tall, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Each locker is airtight and thermal insulated. In case of catastrophic failure the contents will, in theory, be ok. So long as whatever is inside is rescued within 24 hours. After then the sealant and insulation start to break down.
On the center of each door is an inlaid palm reader with it’s own battery source, again in case of spacing to keep scavengers out. Although, this security is mostly for show, the lock itself is very cheep and a crowbar, large stone or even just a well placed shoulder charge could break the lock. If there was a problem, the vacuum of space would probably destroy the lockers and whatever was inside…
