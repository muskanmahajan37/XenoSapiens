You’re awaken suddenly form your sleep, ears ringing, everything is blurry and tinted red, you can’t breath. Everything is silent. 

Suddenly your hearing comes back and hits you like a train. You lean over your pod walls to vomit, but nothing comes out. Sensory overload syndrome, you think to yourself. You stop heaving just enough to look at the flashing red lights and listen to the sirens sing. You heave again. But not from the sound but from what it means:

========
Fight                  [Evil]
Flight
Stick to your training [Good]
========

You tumble out of your pod and franticly reach under it. Your hand finds it’s target as you grope a facemask. You quickly pull it over your head and a stale air mixture starts to fill the mask. Despite a pounding headache with every heartbeat, you concentrate and think: Something’s wrong. You need to work your way to the Bridge.
