The BRIDGE of the Theseus. This room is off limits to most workers aboard the Theseus, but your “critical-crew” designation affords you entrance. The room would be much larger without all the control panels and bulky command terminals dominating much of the space. The ladder climbed leaves you in the back of the room facing the front. There is no windows in this room (or any room on the Theseus). 

This room has an exit ladder in the back of the room to the MAIN ROOM.
